# TODO

## Base game

- roll animation
- figures list
- figures check (from locked dice)
- figure selection (to save a score)
- score sheet
- better UI
- roll sounds
- total score calculation
- background music

## Ideas

- power ups that change rules (reroll number, score calculations..)
- dice alterations (changing faces, adding jokers, more than 6 faces die..)
- animated background (like in Balatro)
